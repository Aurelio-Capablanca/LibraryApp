- first user creation, app must detect if the table Users is empty,
there just make a Select Count() to get a Zero or a number to determine the 
presence of other registers, in order to avoid issues of performance in a future
use it with a limit 1, as well to use an encrypt to save the pass safely (DONE)

- make a login that could read the hash of the pass and say that is right or not
and tell the user the case of use depending on the case, and after that store 
the logged user into a constant value to avoid changes there (seek for possible
limitations on C#)

- make the basic crud for Users (done at first user [reuse it!]) and books and then a form
to manage the lend books, and make that the user get a limit of time based on 
calculations (make changes on the database) (Partially Done)

- Make the mechanism for a book catalogue like some kind of basic pagination, done with 
SQL search of swapping of records (Partially Done)
